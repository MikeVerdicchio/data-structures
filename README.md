Data Structures
===============
This repository contains a collection of data structure implementations in various languages. It serves as my "library" for future projects. Currently, it has the following languages and data structures. This repository is a work-in-progress as I will be adding more (including Python structures) in the future.

* C++
    * Hash Table
    * Heap
    * Huffman Tree
    * ListedList
    * Stack
    * General Tree

* Objective-C
    * LinkedList

The Objective-C and C++ data structures are from lab assignments from the Program and Data Representation (CS 2150) course at the University of Virginia. **If you are a current student in, or are planning to take, CS 2150, it is an Honor Violation to view the code related to those assignments in this repository.**
